# songr
Houses week 3 Code Fellow Labs

### Day One
1. `git clone` this repo onto your machine
2. open the `songr` project in intellij
3. build the project once
4. Run the project using the green play button in the top right
5. In a new Browser window navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
6. Below is a list of routes and their functionality

| Route                 |        Function                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/hello`              | prints 'Hello World.' to the page                                                                             |
| `/capitalize/<input>` | Where input is a string (spaces and special characters okay), prints input to the page in all capital letters |
| `/abums/`             | (WIP) Generates a dumby album, prints all albums in db into a table | 

### Questions I still have
1. What should a proper readme for a completd web app encapsulate? Routes? If I have a working navigation (I don't yet), but if I build the user interface such that my users shouldn't need to modify the navigation bar themselves, would I need to include information about the routes? If not, what would my readers gain from reading my readme?
